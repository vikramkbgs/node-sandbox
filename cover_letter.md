I hope you're doing well. I'm writing to apply for the Full Stack Engineer position at Knovator Technologies. I'm really excited about the chance to work with your team.

I love building websites and apps using Node.js and React. I'm good at fixing problems and making things work smoothly. I also know how to use databases like MongoDB and MySQL.

I went to college for computer science and I've been learning a lot on my own too. Right now, I'm working at ExactSpace Technologies where I'm learning even more.

One project I worked on was a website to help people find roommates. I made sure it was safe and easy to use. I used Amazon Web Services to make it work fast and stay reliable.

I think Knovator Technologies is a great place to work because it's known for doing cool stuff. I'd love to be a part of that and help make even more amazing things.

Thanks for considering my application. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon.
